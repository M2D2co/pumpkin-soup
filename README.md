# Sprinkle Vast Greatness into Your Images: Harness the full power of the SVG

Scalable Vector Graphics, or SVGs, have become a lot more common on the web today. We see them as alternate options to downloading entire icon font libraries, as replacements for pngs and jpegs but what more can they do? Did you know you can access their code directly and manipulate them? Even let you users interact with them?

In this talk we will go over what the SVG code looks like, what it means, and how to generate it. Then we will delve into not only how to manipulate the styles but also how to add functionality in them such as links and click events.
